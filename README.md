# MLSCRATCH
* Contains implementations of popular machine learning algorithms I've come acrossed during graduate studies / further development
* The algorithms can either be: Classifiers (Clf), Regressors (Reg), or Unsupervised (Uns)
* Tests are soon to also be included for the algorithms
___
## Algorithms
### Anomaly Detector (Clf)
* Learns to classify if data points should be considered as outliers or not.

### Gaussian Process (Reg)
* Mean shifted implementationallowing it to avoid the tyical problems where mean is assumed to be 0 or sample mean.

### K Means Clustering (Uns)
* Common unsupervised clustering technique. 

### *K* Nearest Neighbours (Clf, Reg)
* Non parametric method to predict values based on nearby training points.

### Linear Regression (Reg)
* Predict continuous data using a linear model.

### Logistic Regression (Clf)
* Create a decision boundary to enable binary classification.

### Naive Bayes Classifier (Clf)
* Assuming fully independant variables, allows for prediction based on cumulative probability.

### Neural Network (Clf)
* Numerous independant algorithms networking together to produce non linear decision boundaries like XOR.

## Tests
* Coming Soon
