# MLSCRATCH
This respository contains various machine learning models implemented from scratch as part of the MA50263 "Mathematics of Machine Learning" module I'm undertaking as part of my graduate studies.

### KNN : k nearest neighbours classification / regression
##### TODO
* Add proper doccumentation to the knn class
* Add regression functionality to the knn class
* Update the classification function as sometimes incorrect clssifications are being made by knn, likely due to the `np.bincount`
